# Hawaiian-Wordle-Clone

Deployment: https://hawaiian-wordle.onrender.com/

Wordle for those who intend to learn more Hawaiian. It also has my own additions to it that doesn't make it identical to NYT's infamous wordle.

There is a second page after your game end(win or loose) which you can learn more about the selected word
It will present you with all the definitions of the Hawaiian word
If there are any words you do not understand present in the definition you can simply click and highlight the word in question,
and the program will provide the definition of that word(Hawaiian->English & Vice Versa)
